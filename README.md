# NLECA-Core-Newsletter-App
This is a project for updating an insanely old and outdated website from about 10 years ago.

As long as I am laid-off with the whole COVID-19 thing going on, I am using the time to update my skills, and update an old website that
I made many years ago. Two birds with one stone. This is my first foray into .NET Core, and using Azure, so please don't laugh (at least
not too hard) if you see any code that is silly. Instead, reach out to me and let me know. We all get by with a little help from our
friends, right?!
